            <div class="text-justify alexu-text">
                    <p>The AlexandriaU-CRCICA Pre-Moot (hereinafter the "Pre-Moot" or the "Competition") is an international legal education event and a “Sponsor 
                        Pre-Moot” for the international long-standing moot competitions of “the Willem C. Vis and the Willem C. Vis East International Commercial 
                        Arbitration Moots”, which are held annually in the Republic of Austria and Hong Kong SAR. An international conference on the fields of 
                        International Commercial Arbitration and International Trade Law shall be organized along with the Competition (hereinafter the 
                        "Conference"), (hereinafter jointly the "Event").
                    </p>The AlexandriaU-CRCICA International Pre-Moot and Conference has been initiated by virtue of a protocol of cooperation between Alexandria 
                    University and the Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (CRCICA), which has been concluded on the 23rd of December 
                    2019.
                    <p>This year, the Event is going to take place at the iconic Bibliotheca Alexandrina on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea in the Egyptian 
                        cosmopolitan city of Alexandria, the pearl of the Mediterranean and the beautiful land of history and civilization, during the first week 
                        of March 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>The registration for the Pre-Moot is free of charge, and there are limited opportunities for covering the accommodation expenses available. 
                        Also, visa assistance could be provided.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Event will include an international conference, workshops and sessions, practice and final rounds, and social program; in addition to 
                        having guest-star and international arbitrators, speakers, and panelists, including some of those who are judging in the Vis Moots.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="display-4 mb-3 Alexu-title">Vision</h1>
                    <p>In AlexandriaU-CRCICA, we believe that "Mooting" is the best practical method and clinical tool to train law students, and that it is 
                        the closest experience that a law student can have whilst at university to appearing in court or arbitration proceedings
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, we are certain that economic progress, prosperity, and development in Egypt and the Region at the present time, in turn, require 
                        more consideration to be given to the fields of International Trade Law, International Commercial Arbitration, and Alternative Dispute 
                        Resolution.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1 class="display-4 mb-3 Alexu-title">Mission and Goals</h1>
                    <p>We are looking forward to forming a very well organized event. We are aiming that the Pre-Moot will be the largest international 
                       competition for law students in Egypt, Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. And will be one of the most considerable events in 
                       the legal communities in Egypt and the Region.
                    </p>
                    <p>We are aspiring, as well, that one day the Pre-Moot will turn into a third Vis Moot along with the Vis Moot in Vienna and the Vis East Moot 
                        in Hong Kong; thus, enabling more law students from the African continent and Middle East region to have the wonderful and amazing 
                        experience of participating in an international moot competition in general, and participating in the Vis Moots in particular. 
                        Besides achieving the goals of the Vis Moots on a wider range and spreading the concept of mooting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Moreover, we believe in the importance of developing the legal communities and evolving the quality of legal education in Alexandria, Egypt, 
                        and the wider regions. And of course, an event with such nature will contribute to this.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our goal is to enable the participating teams to have an unparalleled experience by participating in the Pre-Moot. They would have the 
                        opportunity to well prepare for the Vis Moots through the workshops and lectures which will take place on the sidelines of the Pre-Moot. 
                        In addition to pleading in the presence of highly experienced and qualified arbitrators who will be judging the teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>They will also experience the amazing city of Alexandria and will have the opportunity to explore Egypt too, whilst the AlexandriaU-CRCICA 
                        Team will be glad to help them to enjoy their time in Egypt in general, and Alexandria in particular.
                    </p>
                    <p>We are aiming also to contribute to spreading the idea and notions of Arbitration as a method of alternative dispute resolution and 
                        resorting to it for resolving international commercial disputes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Moreover, whilst the overall orientation in Egypt at the present time is to develop the business and tourism sectors, enrich the progress 
                       of the economic development scheme, and delivering the appropriate image about Egypt and that it is a safe place for everyone; thus, 
                       we are aiming to have a positive role in this endeavors.
                    </p>
                    <p>Further, whilst Alexandria is a major economic and an important industrial center, and in light of the present investment flows and business 
                        development, we believe in the importance of evolving business environments from the perspective of the dispute resolution methods. Also, 
                        for instance, it is not far from Alexandria the economic paradigm shift taking place in new cities and the megaprojects executed there, 
                        showing the progressive nature of the Egyptian economy and the business sector in Egypt, which in turn needs special steps towards economic 
                        sustainability and prosperity; Especially in Alexandria, as it is considered the second most important city and the main port in Egypt which 
                        handles over three-quarters of Egypt's foreign trade.
